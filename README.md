Yaffuts: Yet Another Framework For Unit Testing Scala

It looks like this: 
(Just like most xUnit test framework. If not, then it looks like in the scala way. :P)

	import yaffuts._

	class TestUnitTest extends Test {
	  test ("given assert fail execute should fail total increase") {
		val sut = new AssertFailTestClass

		sut.run()

		Assert.areEqual(sut.expectFailure, sut.failTotal)
	  }

	  test ("given throw null exception should fail total increase") {
		val sut = new ThrowNullExceptionTestClass

		sut.run()

		Assert.areEqual(sut.expectFailure, sut.failTotal)
	  }
	}
